/**
 * Implements the WebSocketConnection interface via libsignal-net
 *
 * Notable implementation choices:
 * - [chatConnection] contains either an authenticated or an unauthenticated connections
 * - keep-alive requests are sent on both authenticated and unauthenticated connections, mirroring the existing OkHttp behavior
 * - [org.whispersystems.signalservice.api.websocket.WebSocketConnectionState] reporting is implemented
 *   as close as possible to the original implementation in
 *   [org.whispersystems.signalservice.internal.websocket.OkHttpWebSocketConnection].
 * - we expose fake "psuedo IDs" for incoming requests so the layer on top of ours can work with IDs, just
 *    like with the old OkHttp implementation, and internally we map these IDs to AckSenders
